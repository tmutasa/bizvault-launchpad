<p><span class="xx-large"><strong>H</strong></span><strong>ow would you like to start making serious money like what many marketing top guns are doing right now?</strong></p>
<p>If you are currently selling your own product or rendering your own service, and you want to make at least 5 to 10 times more than what you are making right now - without exerting even half the efforts you're expecting to put in - this is for you.</p>
<p>The key to unlock your financial freedom and make an explosive impact to your monthly bottom-line is in <u>DUPLICATION</u>.</p>
<p>As long as you have a product you are selling - or a skill you are rendering - and it can be duplicated, you've struck your own goldmine! This is what a lot of experts, professionals and self-employed's do to explode their revenue and income: they start their own seminars or coaching programs!</p>
<h2>&quot;Why You Should Consider Starting Your Own Coaching Program Today...&quot;</h2>
<p>If you have a skill that's in demand, you can plug in a second income-stream by teaching that skill!</p>
<p>There is leverage in a classroom: you make more money teaching a group of students at a go vs. one-on-one arrangements.</p>
<p>Better clients to work with - if you sell your products or service too cheap, the problem is you usually attract cheap customers who do nothing but consume your time and effort, and eats into the true worth of your time.</p>
<h2>&quot;Unfortunately, Starting Your Own Coaching Program Isn't Easy...&quot;</h2>
<p>Because if you are in the conventional seminar business - as in you arrange the premise to gather your students, advertise in the local papers, hire staff or recruit volunteers, yadda yadda yadda...</p>
<p>This is just too much effort for one person. And even if you work in a group, will the paltry profit margin justify your efforts?</p>
<p>This is exactly why I love to do things &quot;The E-Coaching Way&quot;.</p>
<h1 class="red">“Introducing E-Coaching Secrets...”</h1>
<h2>  Run Seminars From Home &amp; Generate Truckload of Cash Teaching What You Love!</h2>

<h2 class="red">But Wait!... That's Not All!</h2>
<p>Are you ready to put the pedal to the metal, raise the bar and start making BIG BUCKS like what some of the world's richest marketers do?</p>
<p>If you want to be able to move thousand dollar products to the front of your customers - or even higher priced products - make voluminous sales on these high ticket items and do it all without working your butt off, this is going to be a life-changing message for you.</p>
<h2>“Truth About High Ticket Marketing Exposed...”</h2>
<p>You see, when it comes to selling higher priced products many marketers are confused and mistake these 'myths' for truths. Do you find any of these familiar?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="background-color:#FFFF99"><strong>MYTH #1: It takes a lot of effort to make my own high ticket product.</strong></span><br />
    <strong>TRUTH:</strong> In actual fact, it takes just as much effort to market a high ticket product as it takes for a lowly priced product. Sure, you have to do better convincing, but not necessarily MORE EFFORT. Also, did you know that it is possible to start selling high ticket products without creating it first? (I show you how in my course 'High Ticket Blueprint'!)</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:#FFFF99"><strong>MYTH #2: I need a lot of credibility before I can start selling high ticket products.</strong></span><br />
    <strong>TRUTH:</strong> A lot of customers who buy high ticket products usually have never heard of these sellers until they read their sales letter. While not all sales are made on first contact, these sellers are smart enough to capture their email address to let their autoresponder do the follow-ups... automatically! I show how this is done in my course too, and it's easy!</p>
  <p><span style="background-color:#FFFF99"><strong>MYTH #3: Not everyone has the deep pockets to blow that kind of money away!</strong></span><br />
    <strong>TRUTH:</strong> Now that's what I call 'scarcity thinking' at work. The problem with this kind of thinking is that you think the world doesn't have enough money to go around. Well newsflash: there's 1.4 trillion dollars circulating around the world electronically... every single day! And when you sell premium products, you attract... what? Yep, premium customers! You don't need 100 customers paying you $10 when you can get 10 customers paying you $1000 each!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, high ticket marketing is not just reserved for the big boys... and I'm about to lower the barrier of entry for you!</p>
<p>The High Ticket Blueprint is a 3-part step-by-step module to generating ideas for your high ticket products, how to implement them, and start pocketing in the big cash... while working less!</p>

  <h2><span class="red">Bonus Module 1 </span>- The Secret:<br />
    Value for Money</h2>
  <p><img src="images/video05.gif" alt="eCoaching Success" align="left" hspace="10" />Have you wondered that why even though everyone has 24 hours, why are people earning various incomes? Take a janitor and business consultant for example. A janitor earns $5 an hour but a business consultant can earn $500-$1,000 per hour just consulting. This is because one person provides more value to the society than the other!</p>
  <p>Understand this: this is one of the biggest keys to making more money with less effort. When it comes to high ticket products, the key is to provide massive value that people are willing to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars! And I will show you exactly how!</p>

<h2>&quot;Are YOU Going To Be The Next E-Coaching Millionaire?&quot;</h2>
<p>If the information in this course can help you generate an extra one or two more digits in front of whatever you're making right now... how much do you think this course is worth?</p>
<p><strong>Imagine if you can sell just ONE (and I'm being modest here)...</strong></p>
<p>Yes, just one...</p>
<p>One $1000 product.</p>
<p>That's already 10 times what I intend to price this package for.</p>

<p><strong>How much do you think I should be selling this for?</strong></p>

They may very well be competitors in the same business. Are you willing to step up the plate, or forfeit this to your competitor?</p>
<p>But I'm going to bend a bit this time because I want to first prove to you that I'm the real deal. And since you're going to get all the insider scoop on starting your own online coaching program without all the hassles, guesswork, frustration, confusion, and delays...</p>
